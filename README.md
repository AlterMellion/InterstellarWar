# Interstellar War

# ToDo
## Features
- new level after winning: keep the same ships but make them shoot
- splash screens: add fading in and out
- bonus
    - add feedback regarding overheat
- add a boss fight
    - improve accuracy when shooting at the boss: no colision with the tip of the wings
    - improve boss movement: diagonals, unexpected change

## Bugs
- during the count down, there are still collision with the spaceship though its not display. Most likely because it's still registered
- check why the enemy ships stall, sometimes, after a collision,if the playership doesn't move
