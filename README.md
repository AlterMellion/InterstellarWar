# Interstellar War

# ToDo
## Features
- next level
  - add a transition, with the ship going upward
  - play different sound track (smooth fade transition if possible)
  - check why the right enemies aren't loaded
  - make them shoot
  - refactor the code when reaching 3 level
- splash screens: add fading in and out
- bonus
    - add feedback regarding overheat
- add a boss fight
    - improve accuracy when shooting at the boss: no colision with the tip of the wings
    - improve boss movement: diagonals, unexpected change, make sure it4s more random
    - prevent shooting when the boss is arriving

## Bugs
- during the count down, there are still collision with the spaceship though its not display. Most likely because it's still registered
- check why the enemy ships stall, sometimes, after a collision,if the playership doesn't move
